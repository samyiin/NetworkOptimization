When explaining the choices we made in this project, we need to consider the following aspects:
1. Iteration count: Too few? Too high? Convergence detection?
No need too much, enough to converge.

2. Warmup rounds: What to consider?
No need too much, enough to converge.

3. Exclusivity: Make sure that our server only listens to our client, not other clients.
This can simply be solved by exchange information before we start.

Find the best combo for the results. (Consider each message size, different distribution of message size might require
different set of parameters.)

How many times of copy? See group

max_inline? Get it from QP, and then if message size < max_inline, we will send it by in line

need to look into what is a channel in ibv_create_comp_channel, and it's something relates to Host Channel Adapter.
And also, I understand what is a QP, but in which physical existence is it?
Also the "use_event" in completion queue

Need to look at what is service level (sl)

Also, for multi client, maybe worth check out protection domain

look into port_info
