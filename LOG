When explaining the choices we made in this project, we need to consider the following aspects:
1. Iteration count: Too few? Too high? Convergence detection?
No need too much, enough to converge.

2. Warmup rounds: What to consider?
No need too much, enough to converge.

3. Exclusivity: Make sure that our server only listens to our client, not other clients.
This can simply be solved by exchange information before we start.

Find the best combo for the results. (Consider each message size, different distribution of message size might require
different set of parameters.)
